= Harker

http://github.com/technomancy/harker

== Description

Harker means Rails deployments via RubyGems--because a package manager
is a terrible thing to waste.

== Motivation

This will mean you can use the same infrastructure you already rely on
for your dependencies to manage your application itself. It means
never having to keep a checkout of your app just for deployment. It
also becomes very easy to see what versions are installed on a given
box and even run multiple versions at the same time on different
ports.

In short: you've already got a package manager. Why are you handling
installation of your deployed apps with a one-off tool?

== Setup

Your Rails app will need to be modified a bit to become a gem and work
with Harker. But don't worry, these modifications will improve your
app and make it more awesome. Running "harker /path/to/rails/app" will
attempt to turn it into a gem that uses Hoe. You may need to perform a
bit of tweaking in order to get it to build cleanly since every app is
different--see the one in test/sample/ for an example of how this
works.

You don't have to use Hoe if you want to turn your app into a gem
manually or using another library, but it helps.

== Usage

Once your app is a gem, install it locally with "rake install_gem",
and you should be able to use the bin wrapper to generate a new
instance:

  $ your_app init /var/myapp

Then edit /var/myapp/database.yml with your database settings. At that
point you should be able to bring up your database:

  $ RAILS_ENV=production your_app migrate /var/myapp

Test it out by dropping into the console:

  $ RAILS_ENV=production your_app console /var/myapp

Then you can start and stop your application server via Rack:

  $ RAILS_ENV=production your_app start /var/myapp --daemon
  $ RAILS_ENV=production your_app stop /var/myapp

If you omit the second argument, it defaults to the current directory.

For deployment, simply publish your gem to a gem server (public or
private), install it on the target server, and launch it via the bin
wrappers.

== Requirements

* rails (at least 2.3.2)
* a Rails app to use it with
* rubygems
* hoe (technically optional)

== Install

* sudo gem install technomancy-harker --source=http://gems.github.com --source=http://gems.rubyforge.org

== Todo

* use per-instance config.ru scripts for greater rack flexibility
* make Hoe play nicely with Rails' test tasks
* automate /etc/init.d scripts
* rake tasks for remotely installing gem
* make it easy to "rake release" to a private gem repo
